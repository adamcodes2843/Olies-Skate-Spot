## FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project - Product Landing Page

### Completed 09/18/22

Put some effort into this project early on in my fCC journey. Had a lot of practice implementing responsive web design principles, css concepts, animations, layouts, media queries, etc. This project was rewarding to work through as a creative outlet and problem solving exercise. Maybe I'll fix screen height issues and create a working login, cart, etc one day.
