## FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project - Product Landing Page

### Completed 09/18/22

Put some effort into this project early on in my fCC journey. Had a lot of practice implementing responsive web design principles, css concepts, animations, layouts, media queries, etc. This project was rewarding to work through as a creative outlet and problem solving exercise.

I see some problems occur on devices such as laptops with smaller screen heights, but it was great practice for getting the website to work with different screen widths on my home computer. Maybe I'll fix it one day and create a working login, cart, etc.
